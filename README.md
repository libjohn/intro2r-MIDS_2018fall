This repository contains supporting datasets and files for our [**Intro to R**](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/intro2r/) workshop by the [Data & Visualization Services Department](http://library.duke.edu/data), Duke University Libraries. You can find more information about our future and past [workshops](http://library.duke.edu/data/news)

-   our *guide* can be found at our [Rfun site](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/intro2r/)

Outline
-------

1.  Download the zipped repository ![Download ZIP button](images/clone.png "Download ZIP button")
2.  Unzip/expand the zipped repo as a folder **in your Documents Directory**
3.  Launch RStudio
4.  File &gt; New Project...
5.  Existing Directory: Browse to your unzipped copy in the documents directory

        1.  New Code Chunk: *Ctrl+Alt+I*
        2.  R Markdown: brief explanation
    2.  [`library(tidyverse)`](https://tidyverse.org)

6.  Load & View Tibble (data frame)

7.  Data Structure & Data Types (brief)

8.  [`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) -- part of tidyverse

    1.  `filter` rows
    2.  `arrange` rows by variables
    3.  `select` columns

    3.  [answers.Rmd](answers.Rmd)

10. Basic Exploratory Data Analysis

    1.  Read in new datasets
    2.  `library(skimr)`

11. More `dplyr` -- join two datasets

    1.  `left_join` to merge data

12. More Visualize with `ggvis` (syntactically simpler than ggplot2, but...)

    1.  Basic visualization (Scatter Plot, Box Plot, Histogram, Bar Chart)
    2.  Take the ggplot2 workshop, or see the [materials](https://github.com/data-and-visualization/ggplot2-S18)
    3.  Resource: <https://rfun.library.duke.edu/intro2r/visualization.html>
